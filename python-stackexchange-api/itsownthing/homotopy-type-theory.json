Moreover, we assume that our universes are cumulative, that is that all the elements of the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ universe are also elements of\n  the $(i+1)^{\\mathrm{th}}$ universe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet, when I look at the formation rules for the various types in appendix A, at first glance, if a universe appears above the bar as a premise, the same universe appears below. For instance for the coproduct types formation rule:</p>\n\n<p>$$\\dfrac{\\Gamma \\vdash A : \\mathcal{U}_i \\quad \\Gamma \\vdash B : \\mathcal{U}i}{\\Gamma \\vdash A + B : \\mathcal{U}_i}(+\\mbox{-}FORM)$$</p>\n\n<p>So my question is why is a hierarchy necessary? <strong>Under what circumstances do you need to jump from a universe to one higher in the hierarchy?</strong> It is really not obvious to me how given any combination of $A_m: \\mathcal{U}_i$, you can end up with a type $B$ that is <strong>not</strong> in $\\mathcal{U}_i$. In more details: the formation rules in sections of the appendix A.2.4, A.2.5, A.2.6, A.2.7, A.2.8, A.2.9, A.2.10, A.3.2, either mention $\\mathcal{U}_i$ in the premise and judgement, or just in the judgement. </p>\n\n<p>The book also hints that there is a formal way to assign universes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If there is any doubt about whether an\n  argument is correct, the way to check it is to try to assign levels consistently to all universes appearing in it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>What is the process for assigning levels consistently?</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/12929/example-of-a-false-proposition-when-assuming-type-type">$\\mathcal{U}:\\mathcal{U}$ would lead to the Russell paradox</a>.\nAvoiding the Russell paradox is explicitly mentioned in the book (page 24). It also goes into more details page 54, 55 that is uses \u201cRussell-style universes\u201d rather than \u201cTarski-style universes\u201d. So at a very high level, I take for granted that the theory wants to avoid the paradox. Unfortunately I don\'t have the background to make sense of out that directly. What I am after in this question, is really just scratching the surface by getting some examples of things in $\\mathcal{U}_j$ and not in $\\mathcal{U}_i$ for $j &gt; i$ and may be anything else that give me a feel for how the hierarchies work. </p>\n', 'ViewCount': '172', 'Title': 'Universes in dependent type theory', 'LastEditorUserId': '39', 'LastActivityDate': '2013-10-09T18:44:30.993', 'LastEditDate': '2013-10-09T18:44:30.993', 'AnswerCount': '2', 'CommentCount': '1', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '13296', 'Score': '4', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '9179', 'Tags': '<type-theory><homotopy-type-theory><dependent-types>', 'CreationDate': '2013-07-15T13:01:16.747', 'Id': '13285'}{'color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2,'ViewCount': '441', 'Title': 'What were the research outcomes of the Univalent Foundations Program year (Homotopy Type Theory)', 'LastEditDate': '2013-12-15T05:57:58.050', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'Score': '5', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '1709', 'FavoriteCount': '2', 'Body': u'<p>The Institute for Advanced Study <a href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/events/" rel="nofollow">has had</a> a year-long special program devoted to the <a href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/" rel="nofollow">Univalent Foundations Program</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of this they have produced a <a href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/" rel="nofollow">book</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT" rel="nofollow">code repository</a>. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of this we see a blog entry in Scientific American claiming:</p>\n\n<p><em>...it could provide a new, self-contained foundation for all of mathematics.</em></p>\n\n<p>Now this is a bold claim.
