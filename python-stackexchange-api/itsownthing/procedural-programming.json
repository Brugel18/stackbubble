Now I have started to read <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1878739069" rel="nofollow"><em>"Object-Oriented Programming in Turbo C++ first edition (1st edition)"</em></a> by Robert Lafore. I do not have any knowledge of programming which is beyond these books. This book might be outdated because it\'s 20 years old. I do have the latest edition, I am using the old because I like it, mainly I am just studying the basic concepts of OOP used in C++ through the first edition of Lafore\'s book.  </p>\n\n<p>Lafore\'s book emphasizes that "OOP" is only useful for <em>larger</em> and <em>complex</em> programs. It is said in every OOP book (also in Lafore\'s book) that procedural paradigm is prone to errors e.g. the global data as easily vulnerable by the functions. It is said that programmer can make <em>honest</em> errors in procedural languages e.g. by making a function that accidentally corrupts the data.    </p>\n\n<p>Honestly speaking I am posting my question because I am not grasping the explaination given in this book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672323087" rel="nofollow">Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (4th Edition)</a> I am not grasping these statements written in Lafore\'s book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Object-oriented programming was developed because limitations were discovered in\n  earlier approaches to programming....\n  As programs grow ever larger and more complex, even the structured programming approach begins to show signs of strain... \n  ....Analyzing the reasons for these failures reveals that there are weaknesses in the procedural paradigm itself. No matter how well the structured programming approach is implemented, large programs become excessively complex....\n  ...There are two related problems. First, functions have unrestricted access to global data. Second, unrelated functions\n  and data, the basis of the procedural paradigm, provide a poor model of the real world...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have studied the book "dysmystified C++" by Jeff Kent, I like this book very much, in this book mostly procedural programming is explained. I do not understand why procedural(structured) programming is weak!</p>\n\n<p>Lafore\'s book explains the concept very nicely with some good examples. Also I have grasped an intuition by reading Lafore\'s book that OOP is better than procedural programming but I am curious to know how exactly in practice procedural programming is weaker than OOP.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see myself what are the practical problems that one would face in procedural programming, how the OOP will make the programming easier. I think I will got my answer just by reading Lafore\'s book contemplatively but I want to see with my own eyes the problems in the procedural code, I want to see how the OOP style code of a program removes the foregoing errors that would happen if the same program were to be written using procedural paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>There are many features of OOP and I understand it is not possible for someone to explain me how all these features removes the foregoing errors that would generate by writing the code in procedural style.</p>\n\n<p>So, here is my question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Which limitations of procedural programming does OOP address and how does it effectively remove these limitations in practice?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In particular, are there examples for programs which are hard to design using the procedural paradigm but are easily designed using OOP?</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '219', 'Title': 'What problems of procedural programming does OOP solve in practice?', 'LastEditorUserId': '98', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-03-28T04:02:51.607', 'LastEditDate': '2014-03-25T08:30:22.733', 'AnswerCount': '6', 'CommentCount': '5', 'Score': '5', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '11633', 'Tags': '<object-oriented><programming-paradigms><procedural-programming>', 'CreationDate': '2014-03-20T14:47:25.803', 'FavoriteCount': '2', 'Id': '22867'}},
