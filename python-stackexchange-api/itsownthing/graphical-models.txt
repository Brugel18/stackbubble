The basic premise is that we need to find out the initial states that will give us the desired goal vector. In Paper1 an Immune algorithm is used to generate random populations of input states of the network and in Paper2 Genetic Algorithm is used. The objective function Eg(3) in Paper1 and Eq(7) in Paper2 is the same in both the papers. The following issues are based on Paper2. </p>\n\n<p>Background : The model of the cognitive map is mathematically expressed by Eq(1). There are 2 applications of FCM: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Learning where the weights are unknown and they are optimized using learning algorithms most commonly used in neural network. This is referred to as forward chaining. Here, we test if the FCM converges with the given stimulus or not and we want the FCM to converge to the desired state. The FCM evolves using Eq(1). </p></li>\n<li><p>Finding the initial state vectors that will make the FCM converge to the desired goal- Known as backward chaining. Here the initial state vector is unknown but the target goal is known. I do not understand are the following and will be extremely helpful if somebody can explain what is going on while using the example Fuzzy cognitive Map (FCM) in Figure2</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I am mostly concerned with application two, ginding the initial state vectors which will produce the desired goal. I have two questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>In Paper2 Table 1 lists the initial setting. The weight vector, W only has a diagonal element of 1 but the picture in Fig 2 has a different weight matrix E. During the calculation of the next state when the FCM evolves using Eq(1), which weight matrix is used (either W in Table 1 or in the Fig 2) What is the use of the weight matrix given in Figure2? Is the weight matrix unknown also?</p></li>\n<li><p>Is the weight matrix updated in this Application 2? If the chromosomes represent the states and not the weights, then how come the weight matrix is different as shown in Figure 2?\nCan somebody please explain which weight goes into the objective function and if the weights are also unknown or if they are fixed? If fixed, then which ones are they?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1353927" rel="nofollow">Goal-Oriented Decision Support Based on Fuzzy Cognitive Map</a> by H.
