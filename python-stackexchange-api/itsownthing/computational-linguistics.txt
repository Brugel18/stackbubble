{'Body': '<p>I am looking for algorithms to classify words in a paragraph of text.

I've start to mess around with it but I haven't found anything that will work just yet.  I'm also not sure if this toolkit would be the best for this.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I apply the following transformation to tag <code>re</code>, <code>peat</code> and <code>ed</code> in <code>repeated</code>:\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n  \\mathtt{repeated}\n  &amp; \\xrightarrow{\\mathtt{rep} \\mapsto \\mathtt{rp}} \\mathtt{rpeated} \\\\\n  &amp; \\xrightarrow{\\mathtt{ea} \\mapsto \\mathtt{e}} \\mathtt{rpeted} \\\\\n  &amp; \\xrightarrow{\\mathtt{d}\\$ \\mapsto \\epsilon} \\mathtt{rpete} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$</p>\n\n<p>I would like to be able to find out what is left of the stuff I tagged.  So I'd like to see that <code>r</code> is all that is left of the prefix, <code>pe</code> is all that is left of the stem, etc.  Any help or direction is greatly appreciated!</p>\n", 'ViewCount': '25', 'Title': 'Trying to tag parts of a word and keep track of any changes that happen to those parts', 'LastEditorUserId': '39', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-01-29T15:41:39.147', 'LastEditDate': '2014-01-29T15:41:34.770', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '0', 'Score': '1', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '12849', 'Tags': '<algorithms><strings><natural-lang-processing><computational-linguistics>', 'CreationDate': '2014-01-14T19:56:01.060', 'Id': '19725'}
