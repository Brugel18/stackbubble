Then you place it into an NP machine and run it on all possible certificates for some instance of the problem where you\'re not sure if it has a solution. The unconditional reject after <code>f(n)</code> operations ensures the computation terminates within <code>f(n)</code> operations, even when rejecting. So this NP machine can solve the co-NP dual of the NP problem, where you want to reject in polynomial time when there is no solution.</p>\n\n<p>Except that can\'t be right, because it seems to imply <code>NP=co-NP</code> and that\'s not believed to be true. I have an incorrect assumption or inference somewhere. What is it? Why can\'t I avoid NP\'s "negatives might run for a long time or even forever" with algorithm-specific time cutoffs?</p>\n\n<p>A concrete example: suppose you have a 3-SAT verifier that takes no more than <code>42 n^2</code> operations to check a solution to an <code>n</code> clause problem (involving up to <code>3n</code> variables). You then make an NP program like "non-deterministically choose a variable assignment, run verifier for up to 42 n^2 steps, return its result else reject if it didn\'t finish". So within <code>42 n^2</code> operations we\'ll have an answer, and flipping it gives the "is there no satisfying assignment" answer. Why is this not an NP algorithm for the co-NP problem of determining if there is no satisfying assignment to a 3-SAT problem?</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '41', 'Title': "Why doesn't a time cutoff convert NP problems into co-NP?", 'LastEditorUserId': '535', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-03-02T21:08:48.943', 'LastEditDate': '2014-03-02T20:56:00.557', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '1', 'Score': '2', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '535', 'Tags': '<np><intuition><paradox><co-np>', 'CreationDate': '2014-03-02T20:31:20.237', 'FavoriteCount': '2', 'Id': '22204'}
