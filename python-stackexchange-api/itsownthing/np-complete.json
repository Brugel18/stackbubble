That is the problem can be solved in $\\mathcal{O}(|T|!)$.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p>After Tsuyoshi Ito\'s comment I updated the problem. The denominator is changed from $1+\\sum_{c(kj)=c(ij),k \\neq i,e_{kj} \\in T} w_{kj}$ to $1+\\sum_{c(kl)=c(ij),kl \\neq ij} w_{kj}$. Therefore, the denominator contains the weights outside $T$ as well.

That means, the outgoing edges from a node must be of different colors (but the incoming colors can be the same as long as the inequality holds). This puts an intuitive lower bound on the number of colors, which is the maximum out-degree of the nodes in $T$.</p>\n\n<p>As Tsuyoshi mentioned, $w_{ij}$\'s, $T$, and $\\beta$ are inputs to the problem and the edge colors are the output.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Problem does not enforce the edges $e_{ij}$ and $e_{ji}$ be of a same color.</p>\n', 'Tags': '<complexity-theory><graphs><graph-theory><np-complete>', 'LastEditorUserId': '1672', 'LastActivityDate': '2012-07-10T23:58:44.517', 'CommentCount': '11', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '2687', 'CreationDate': '2012-05-29T08:27:39.603', 'Id': '2157'},138_20:{'color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2,'Body': '<p>I have a problem in my mind, I think it is a NPC problem but I don\'t know how to prove it.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the problem:</p>\n\n<p>There are <strong>k</strong> islands in a very big lake, and there are <strong>n</strong>  fan-shaped pontoons.

I will appreciate if someone could shed the light on this topic so that I will be able to continue by myself.\nFew following sentences are questions and my thoughts about relativization, they will help to navigate the discussion. </p>\n\n<p>Very often relativization comes in comparison with diagonalization, which is a method that helps distinguish between countable set and uncountable set. It somehow comes from relativization that $P$ versus $NP$ question cannot be solved by diagonalization. I don\'t really see the idea why relativization show the useless of diagonalization, and if it\'s useless why is actually useless.</p>\n\n<p>The idea behind oracle Turing machine $M^A$ at first is very clear. However, when it comes to $NP^A$ and $P^A$ the intuition disappears. Oracle is a blackbox that is designed for special language and answers the question whether the string on the input of the oracle is in the language in time 1. As I understood TM that contains an oracle is just make some auxiliary operations and ask the oracle. So the core of the TM is the oracle, everything else is less important. What\'s the difference between $P^A$ and $NP^A$, even thought oracle in both of them works in time 1.</p>\n\n<p>The last  thing is the proving the existence of an oracle $B$ such that $P^B \\neq NP^B$. I found the proof in several textbooks and in all of them the proof seems very vague. I tried to use <strong>"Introduction to complexity" by Sipser, Chapter9. Intractability</strong>, and didn\'t get the idea of construction of a list of all polynomial time oracle TMs $M_i$. </p>\n\n<p>This is more or less everything what I know about relativization, I will appreciate if someonw would decide to share his/her thoughts on the topic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Addendum</strong>: in one of the textbooks I found example of $NP^B$ language (Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach by Boaz Barak Sanjeev Arora. Theorem 3.7. Page 74). $U_B=\\left \\{ 1^n:some \\space string \\space of  \\space length \\space  n  \\space is \\space  in \\space B\\right \\} $ it\'s unary language. I believe that (1,11,111,1111,...) are all in $U_B$. Author affirms that such a language is in $NP^B$ which is I cannot understand why, hence oracle for B can resolve everything in time 1. Why do we need nondeterministic TM with oracle.

Lets say we found a shorter route between two cities on the "Main route". So now we can improve our main route and make him shorter, how ever this is not possible as the main route is the shortest rout by definition.</p>\n\n<p>Also I want to show you the definition of sub route,(you can skip this if you think it\'s to obvious) I will show it by example. If I have the next route: A,C,E,F,H,K so sub route between C and F is: A,C,E,F when I want to find a shorter route for this given sub route, I can only change the places of the cities C, and E, there could be only 2 options for sub routes between A, and F.</p>\n\n<p>Now I will try to show you my implementation, and I want you tell me if I made any bad assumptions or having bad calculations.</p>\n\n<p>Lets say you been given the next input of Cities: A,B,C,D,E,F,H. In order to find the shortest path you will need to perform 720 tests($(7-1)!$). I want to show you how you can cut half of those tests. </p>\n\n<p>When you will start to calculate, this is how your first tests will look like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A->B->C->D->E->F->G</li>\n<li>A-><strong>C</strong>-><strong>B</strong>->D->E->F->G</li>\n<li>A-><strong>C</strong>-><strong>B</strong>->D->E-><strong>G</strong>-><strong>F</strong></li>\n<li>A->B->C->D->E-><strong>G</strong>-><strong>F</strong> </li>\n<li>A->B->C->D->F-><strong>E</strong>-><strong>G</strong></li>\n<li>A-><strong>C</strong>-><strong>B</strong>->D-><strong>F</strong>-><strong>E</strong>->G</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When you start calculating test 1, you should stop when reaching city D. Stop and calculate what would be the shortest path, starting at A, finishing at D and going thru B,C. Latter you can assume that any path starting with A, going thru C,B and finished in D no matter how it would continue, if it will not start with the shortest path that you found, it will not be the shortest path. So now you can skip all the tests that start with A,B,C,D or A,C,B,D, depending on which of those paths is shorter.</p>\n\n<p>Now in order to save more than just $\\frac{(N-1)!}{2}$ calculation I will create a longer sub routes and calculate the shortest path between them, dropping all other options. The only problem with that, is I may repeatedly calculate the same sub routes, as I may find them in different parts of the main route. For example: for the given route: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H lets say that I found the shortest route between B to E thru C,D. But that was just from my first test of: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H. Later I will come in to testing: A,F,G,H,B,D,C,E as eventually I will have to test all the options. So again in order to drop part of those options I will try to find what will be the shortest path between B to E thru D,C(Remember I can can drop calculation from any part of the route) and will have to calculate it again. To avoid that I will store all the sub routes calculation in to maps.</p>\n\n<p>So lets see how long it will take me to create all the maps with K cities length. First I need to select the starting city, got N options for that, now select the last city, got $N -1$ options for that, and now select all the cities in between order is not metter and without repetition. I will use <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations-calculator.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> formula for that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>$\\frac{N!}{ (N - R)!R!}$</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In our case $N$ is $N-2$ and $R$ is $K - 2$ so we will get:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>$\\frac{N!} {(N - K)!(K - 2)!}$</strong> The number of $K$ cities length maps from $N$ cities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now lets assume that we created all the $K$ length maps and we want to create $2K - 1$ length maps. We do not need to start from 0, we can use our $K$ length maps to help us. Like this:</p>\n\n<p>Lets say we want to create the next map of 7 cities and we already created a map of 4 cities. So the cities are: A,B,C,D,E,F,H. Our first test will be: A,B,C,D,E,F,H. We can save us lots of time if we split it in two maps of 4 cities. \n - Map 1: From A to D thru B,C\n - Map 2: From D to H thru E,F</p>\n\n<p>Lets see how many maps like this could be: There are 5 options for the common city in the middle and there are $2C4$ options for the first two cities( 2 choice 4, selecting 2 cities out of 4. Order is not important, repetition is not allowed) and the last 2 cities is just what reminds. After summing it up we will have get 30 options to create 1 map of 7 cities.\nLets say it in more general way: To create all the maps for K length cities(assuming that we already created all the $\\frac{(K + 1)}{2}$ length cities maps) will be: $K - 2$ options for the common city at the middle. And $\\frac{(K - 3)} {2}C(K - 3)$ options for the cities that belongs to Map 1. Summing all together we will get:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>$\\frac{(k - 2)!}{(\\frac{K - 3}{2}!)^2}$ The number of calculation need to be done to create $K$ cities length map when we already created $\\frac{K + 1}{2}$ cities length map.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now in order to find the shortest path for $N$ cities length we need to create all the maps with $\\frac{N + 1}{2}$ length and just one map with $N$ length. In cases when $N$ is not belong to $f(x) = f(x - 1)  * 2 - 1$; we will still need to create the biggest maps length group possible but we will have more than 1 city in common when we will split the problem in 2 maps. For example when N = 10. We will create all the 4 length maps, and all the 7 length maps. Lets give a sample: For the given cities A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,A find the shortest path. We will split it in two maps of 7.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Map 1: From A to G thru B,C,D,E,F</li>\n<li>Map 2: From D to A thru E,F,G,H,I</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For map 1 we will choose who is going to be the last city, we have 8 options to that.\nAnd we have $5C8$ options for the cities of the map 1, and the rest is going to map 2. You may ask yourself now how could it be that map 1 will actually have the exact common cities with map 2, isn\'t there a chance that they be ordered in some other way. Well according to my base assumption there isn\'t. so if we will sum it all together we will get: 448 options for that. Now lets say it in general way: To find the shortest path for input of $N$ cities, we will first need to find all the maps with $length &lt; N$ that belongs to $f(x) = f(x - 1)  * 2 - 1; F(0) = 4$. Lets say that the longest map of all those maps is G length and $f^{-1}(G) = G\'$( sorry for not knowing how to express $G$ with $N$). So we will have $N - 2$ options for the last city of map 1 and $(G - 2)C(N - 2)$ summing it up will give:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>$\\frac{(N - 2)!} {(N - G)!(G - 2)!}$</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the efficiency of finding the shortest path for N cities will be(Also added the time it will take to create the first 4 length maps) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>$(\\frac{N(N-1)(N-2)(N-3)}{2}) + (\\sum_{i}^{G\'}\\frac{(f(i) - 2)!}{(\\frac{f(i) - 3}{2}!)^2})+ (\\frac{(N - 2)!} {(N - G)!(G - 2)!})$</p>\n  \n  <p>Using $f(x)=f(x\u22121)\u22172\u22121;F(0)=4$</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think its better than $O(2^N)$</p>\n\n<p>Please help me to do the math, and tell me if I have any mistakes in my math or conclusions.

In particular, should we teach it using Karp reductions or using Turing reductions?</p>\n\n<p>I feel that the concepts of NP-completeness and reductions are something that every computer science major ought to learn.  However, when teaching NP-completeness, I\'ve noticed that the use of Karp reductions has some downsides.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, Karp reductions seem to be unnecessarily confusing for some students.  The intuitive notion of a reduction is "if I have an algorithm to solve problem X, then I can use it to solve problem Y, too".  That\'s very intuitive -- but it maps much better to Turing reductions than to Karp reductions.  As a result, I see students who are trying to prove NP-completeness get led astray by their intuition and form an incorrect proof.  Trying to teach both kinds of reductions and emphasizing this aspect of Karp reductions sometimes feels a little bit like needless formalism and takes up unnecessary class time and student attention on what feels like an inessential technical detail; it\'s not self-evident why we use this more restricted notion of reduction.</p>\n\n<p>I do understand the difference between Karp reductions and Turing (Cook) reductions, and how they lead to different notions of NP-completeness.  I realize that Karp reductions give us a finer granularity of distinctions between complexity classes.  So, for serious study of complexity theory, Karp reductions are obviously the right tool.  But for computer science students who are just learning this and are never going to go into complexity theory, I\'m uncertain whether this finer distinction is critical is critical for them to be exposed to.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, as a student, I remember feeling puzzled when I ran across a problem like "tautology" -- i.e., given a 3CNF formula, check whether it is a tautology.  What was confusing was that this problem is clearly hard: any polynomial-time algorithm for it would imply that $P=NP$; and solving this problem is obviously as hard as solving the tautology problem.  However, even though intuitively tautology is as hard as satisfiability, tautology is not NP-hard.  Yes, I understand today why this is the case, but at the time I remember being puzzled by this.  (What went through my head once I finally understood was: Why do we draw this distinction between NP-hard and co-NP-hard, anyway?  That seems artificial and not very well-motivated by practice.  Why do we focus on NP rather than co-NP?  They seem equally natural.  From a practical perspective, co-NP-hardness seems to have essentially the same practical consequences as NP-hardness, so why do we get all hung up on this distinction?  Yes, I know the answers, but as a student, I remember this just made the subject feel more arcane and poorly motivated.)</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is this.  When we teach NP-completeness to students, is it better to teach using Karp reductions or Turing reductions?  Has anyone tried teaching the concept of NP-completeness using Turing reductions?  If so, how did it go?  Would there be any non-obvious pitfalls or disadvantages if we taught the concepts using Turing reductions, and skipped the conceptual issues associated with Karp reductions?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Related: see <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/11124/755">http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/11124/755</a> and <a href="http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/16376/755">http://cs.stackexchange.com/a/16376/755</a>, which mentions that the reason why we use Karp reductions in the literature is because it enables us to distinguish between NP-hardness and co-NP-hardness.

Let us sum up f edge weights within G. Thus, we have a subset of weights whose sum equals to the value d. Since, all of the edges flow into the vertex. Thus, given f token locations, a value d and a graph G, the path from any vertex to its closest token location(which is itself given self loops) is at most d, where d could be the weight of one edge if f=1 or the sum of the weights of many edges if f>1. given f token locations which refer to f edge weights, the sum of all the f edge weights equals the value d. \nThe edges weights of the f edges traversed included in the subset K, their sum is d. The subset K is equivalent to the subset S' in the subset sum problem and the weight d is equivalent to the target value in the subset problem. </p>\n\n<p>Conclusion: token placement has a solution iff subset sum has a solution. </p>\n\n<p>this means that there are f token locations surrounding vertex v, such that the length of any </p>\n", 'ViewCount': '42', 'ClosedDate': '2014-04-25T06:56:07.297', 'Title': "what's wrong with this NP completeness proof", 'LastEditorUserId': '17053', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-04-25T16:01:41.893', 'LastEditDate': '2014-04-25T16:01:41.893', 'AnswerCount': '0', 'CommentCount': '5', 'Score': '0', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '17053', 'Tags': '<complexity-theory><np-complete><reductions><np>', 'CreationDate': '2014-04-24T23:35:04.413', 'Id': '24091'},138_233:{'color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2,'Body': "<p>A problem is NP-complete if:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It is in NP.</li>\n<li>All problems in NP can reduce to it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It's number 2 that I'm concerned with here.
