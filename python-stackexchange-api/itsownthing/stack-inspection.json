That system libraries need some way of distinguishing between calls originating in untrusted code and calls originating from the trusted application itself. This is done by associating with code the principal corresponding to its origin. Then access permissions are recorded on the stack and whenever a call to a sensitive, system method is made, the stack is traversed to see whether the appropriate permissions for the principal making the call are present on the stack.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What are the limitations of stack inspection?
