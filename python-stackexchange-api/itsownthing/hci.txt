{'Body': '<p>This question might seems vague but heres the context:</p>\n\n<p>When we are focusing on HCI we would most likely be interested on knowing first how the user usually deals with a certain object.

How would you measure its usability (paper one). </p></li>\n<li><p>Then, how would you map it to a system interface? How would you measure the usability now on the system?</p></li>\n<li><p>How would you compare the two usabilities measures?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This question narrows down this approach which is suggested on Stones book - User Interface and Evaluation. </p>\n\n<p>What the catalogue is about is not the point, that why I left it without a description: To avoid suggestions trying to measure what the catalogue is about. My focus here is on the particular mapping of this kind of object on the real world as a simple paper and when it is mapped to a system interface. Assume the catalogue to consist of rows and tables, where each matching row and table gives you a suggestion and you must first reason about each row and each column to see if it suits you (Perhaps you would suggest another template for the catalogue?).</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '50', 'Title': 'How can I measure the usability of a catalogue?', 'LastEditorUserId': '98', 'LastActivityDate': '2012-04-22T16:07:59.883', 'LastEditDate': '2012-04-22T16:07:59.883', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '5', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '1173', 'Score': '2', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '983', 'Tags': '<empirical-research><modelling><hci>', 'CreationDate': '2012-04-09T06:58:17.557', 'Id': '1154'}{'Body': '<p>What is a good textbook for a seminar about </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>virtual environments,  virtual worlds,  augmented reality  and\nsimilar topics?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The seminar is at the graduate studies level and is supposed to give introduction to virtual environments, technologies and applications as well as  current research directions.</p>\n\n<p>A creative commons license and availability online would be a plus.</p>\n\n<p>Here are my own results after some search:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://www.intechopen.com/books/augmented-reality" rel="nofollow">Augmented Reality</a> - open access book at Intechopen</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I was suggested these books (no online access) at another source (ResearchGate):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>"Virtual Reality Technology" (Grigore C.
