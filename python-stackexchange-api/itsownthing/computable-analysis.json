I believe that a PDA has the computational power to equal the computational power of a CPU (cpu in this case is the core elements of a computer ie memory and processor). This is because a PDA utilises a stack which is memory(RAM) in a computer. The PDA has states as does a CPU and also the PDA calculates simple logic at each state. I realise that the PDA itself would be a complex series of states to emulate the computational power of the cpu and there would have to be a series of PDAs to compute different functions.  </p>\n\n<p>My Question:  I know that Turing machines are best used to simulate the logic of a CPU but <strong>am I right in saying that a PDA (Or PDA's) can be designed to be as powerful as a cpu?</strong></p>\n", 'ViewCount': '516', 'Title': 'Is a PDA as powerful as a CPU?', 'LastEditorUserId': '55', 'LastActivityDate': '2012-05-16T13:59:34.493', 'LastEditDate': '2012-05-16T12:48:10.083', 'AnswerCount': '3', 'CommentCount': '0', 'Score': '6', 'OwnerDisplayName': 'Mike Howard', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'Tags': '<computability><computation-models><computable-analysis>', 'CreationDate': '2012-05-16T10:47:59.193', 'Id': '1868''color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2}{'Body': '<p>What is the intuitive idea behind automatic differentiation?</p>\n\n<p>If I have a program which computes $f(x, y)=x^2+yx$, which steps lead to the program which computes the derivative $df/dx$ of f? </p>\n\n<pre><code>double f(double x, double y)\n{\n    double res = x*x;\n    double res2 = x*y;\n    double res3 = res + res2\n    return res3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If I read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation" rel="nofollow">corresponding Wikipedia entry</a> correctly I need nothing besides the chain rule, but I don\'t understand how this can be done in practice.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding so far is that I use a table of the derivatives of all involved basic functions, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>$dx/dx=1$</li>\n<li>$dy/dx=0$</li>\n<li>$d(x*y)/dx=y$</li>\n<li>$d(x+y)=dx/dx+0$</li>\n<li>$d(x^2)/dx=2x$</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>How do I get the final function from this?</p>\n\n<p>I would expect something like this: </p>\n\n<pre><code>double f(double x, double y, double* dx)\n{\n    *dx = 0;\n    double res = x*x;\n    ? *dx = 2*x ?\n    double res2 = x*y;\n    ? *dx = *dx ?\n    double res3 = res + res2\n    ? *dx = ??? ?\n\n    return res3;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Edit:</em> I have found this video <a href="http://vimeo.com/6622658" rel="nofollow">"Beautiful Differentiation"</a> of a talk at the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) 2009, by Marcom Wallace which explains the topic quite well.</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '68', 'Title': 'How does automatic differentiation work?', 'LastEditorUserId': '13187', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-01-29T16:07:12.470', 'LastEditDate': '2014-01-29T16:07:12.470', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '1', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '20048', 'Score': '2', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '13187', 'Tags': '<computer-algebra><computable-analysis>', 'CreationDate': '2014-01-28T21:32:43.563', 'Id': '20047''color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2}
