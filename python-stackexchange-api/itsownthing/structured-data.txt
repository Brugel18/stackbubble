{'Body': "<p>Access control models are typically very coarse-grained, allowing one access to a resource (possibly with some combination of read/write/execute permission) or exclude such access. Some models of database security allow access to be granted on a per row basis (though I don't have a reference handy).</p>\n\n<p>Have fine-grained access control models been designed to limit access to <em>parts of</em> an XML document? What could/should a model look like? Has any work been done in this area? Are other security models applicable in this context?</p>\n\n<p>For example, one could imagine that the model prevents access to a particular subtree. The subtree could either be removed or encrypted.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note that this need not explicitly apply to XML. Any models devised for semi-structured data are also interesting.</em></p>\n", 'ViewCount': '164', 'Title': 'Fine-grained security models for XML data', 'LastEditorUserId': '41', 'LastActivityDate': '2012-03-26T10:10:01.867', 'LastEditDate': '2012-03-26T04:51:11.563', 'AnswerCount': '2', 'CommentCount': '0', 'Score': '4', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '31', 'Tags': '<security><access-control><structured-data>', 'CreationDate': '2012-03-16T11:58:48.767', 'Id': '435'}{'Body': '<p>I am looking at a modelling tool and are trying to determine all the types of ways that you can model (at a rudimentary level) </p>\n\n<p>I remember seeing a list of ways in which you can connect or categorise information elements. basically the types were as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lists - constitute a list of information elements</li>\n<li>Hierarchies- visualise information in a parent-child relationship (ie organisational chart)</li>\n<li><p>Flows - connect elements in a logical (lateral) flow (ie process model)</p>\n\n<p>Have you seen any reference to these types, or can you elaborate on the full list of "model types"</p></li>\n</ul>\n', 'ViewCount': '74', 'Title': 'What are the rudimentary types of information connectivity i.e. model types?', 'LastEditorUserId': '98', 'LastActivityDate': '2012-08-14T20:46:24.903', 'LastEditDate': '2012-08-14T20:46:24.903', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '0', 'Score': '4', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '2512', 'Tags': '<data-structures><information-theory><modelling><structured-data>', 'CreationDate': '2012-08-14T16:01:08.207', 'FavoriteCount': '1', 'Id': '3182'}
