{'Body': '<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/bamMN.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>\n\n<p>Here is a resource allocation graph asked in my Operating Systems Theory midterm. The question is, "Is there a deadlock here? Explain your answer in detail"</p>\n\n<p>Ra and Rb are resource sets and every dot inside of them are resources. Circles are processes. An arrow from process to a resource set means that process is requesting a resource from that set. An arrow from resource set to process means that process owns a resource from that resource set.</p>\n\n<p>I want to have your opinions on this, because the lecturer\'s answer is conflicting with mine. Lecturer says there is a deadlock here. But my answer was, since Py and Pz are not requesting a resource, they will simply continue their execution and terminate, releasing their resources. Then Px and Pw can obtain their requested resources and keep executing. It is obvious there is a cycle in this graph as Px-Pw but this doesn\'t conclude us to a deadlock. Thus I can\'t see a way to make "there is a deadlock here"conclusion. </p>\n\n<p>So is there a deadlock here?</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '179', 'Title': 'Deadlock and cycle in a resource allocation graph', 'LastEditorUserId': '39', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-02-01T13:56:33.677', 'LastEditDate': '2014-02-01T13:56:33.363', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '2', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '20137', 'Score': '0', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '11579', 'Tags': '<operating-systems><concurrency><resource-allocation><deadlocks>', 'CreationDate': '2014-01-30T20:46:42.123', 'Id': '20131''color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2}
