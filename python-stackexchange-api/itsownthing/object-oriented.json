{'Body': '<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsumption_architecture" rel="nofollow">subsumption architecture</a>, proposed by Rodney Brooks in 1986, is a "bottom-up" approach, in which robots are designed using simple hierarchical models.  These models build upon and subsume the lower modules to form a final product.  For example, a robot can be given a "find opening" module which is subsumed by a more abstract "find doorway" module, which is then itself subsumed by an "exit the playing field" module.</p>\n\n<p>Now, obviously, in a more "object-oriented" design, we could have started the design with the "exit the playing field module", but for sake of argument, assume some of the more primitive components (as "functions") will likely get reused in other higher concepts.</p>\n\n<p>Realizing that implementing this robot in a procedural language (or a functional one, for that matter) could be the simplest, but is it counterproductive to try to conceive of a subsumption architecture-based robot in an object-oriented programming paradigm? (realizing also that it\'s perhaps difficult to weigh a software engineering paradigm against a robotics one)  To obtain a solution, is there some form of "adapter" that can be implemented for increasing the effectiveness of using what may be two conflicting paradigms? </p>\n', 'ViewCount': '105', 'Title': 'Can bottom-up architectures be effectively programmed in top-down paradigms?', 'LastEditorUserId': '98', 'LastActivityDate': '2012-08-07T08:22:06.383', 'LastEditDate': '2012-08-07T08:22:06.383', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '4', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '2945', 'Score': '3', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '88', 'Tags': '<programming-languages><artificial-intelligence><algorithm-design><object-oriented>', 'CreationDate': '2012-07-28T05:25:40.627', 'Id': '2938''color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2}{'ViewCount': '255', 'Title': 'Why classes implicitly derive from only the Object Class?', 'LastEditDate': '2012-08-07T08:17:37.153', 'AnswerCount': '3', 'Score': '2', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '2385', 'FavoriteCount': '2', 'Body': '<p>I do not have any argument opposing why we need only a single universal class.

For my work I need to apply contracts to Java bytecode. The question is only about using contracts on Java bytecode, nothing more.</p>\n\n<p>If you ask, why do you want to use contracts on Java bytecode, there is a reason. The reason is that I use a Java extension. This Java extension takes source code consisting of extended Java code, from which it generates bytecode. I want to use this Java extension and additionally I want to use contracts. The extension doesn\'t support contracts. So I have my extended Java code, I apply to it the compiler of the Java extension and I get Java bytecode. On this resulting bytecode I want to apply contracts. </p>\n\n<p>The Java extension is called Object Teams[4], also called eclipse object teams. The Java extension allows to use dynamic collaborations and aspects, which are not part of regular Java code. </p>\n\n<p>Right now I only need a hack or workaround to get one or two small examples working.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My idea so far:</strong><br>\nThis is irrelevant to the question. But it shows that my current plan is cumbersome and I need a better solution (thus the question). Also, perhaps someone has worked with JML/OpenJML and might know how to do this plan but better. </p>\n\n<p>There is a tool for contracts for Java language. The tool is called java modeling language(JML)[3][5]. The tool does not support contract for Java bytecode. The tool only supports contracts on Java source code. I want to rewrite part of the tool to support contracts on java bytecode (a solution to my question but a cumbersome one).</p>\n\n<p>Currently there is only one working version of the java modeling language(JML), which is called OpenJML[6]. I plan to use OpenJML on Java bytecode (remember, OpenJML doesn\'t support contracts for bytecode, only contracts for Java source code). I don\'t want to use contracts on any bytecode. I want to use contract on bytecode that is generated by a Java extension. (The Java extension is called ObjectTeams, but this is irrelevant for the question).</p>\n\n<p>(Annotations mean annotations that are part of the Java language, e.g., "@Overrides".)</p>\n\n<p>The approach would be to search for specific annotations in the bytecode that is generated by a Java extension. Those specific annotations specify contracts. I have to look for the specific annotations in the bytecode (bytecode that is generated by a Java extension), compile them to Java guard expressions, i.e., code that throws an exception if the contracts are not honored. I can get the compiled Java guard expression by using the library behind OpenJML. Then I need to add the byte code of the Java guard expression at the place where I found the specific annotations that represent contracts. </p>\n\n<p><strong>My question:</strong><br>\nUsing OpenJML seems possible, but difficult to achieve. Right now I just need a solution that works for one or two small examples, so the solution can be a hack or just a temporary solution. As my approach via OpenJML is probably difficult to achieve and further will take quite some time, I look for different solutions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>What options would you recommend to apply contracts (design by contract) for java bytecode?</em></p>\n\n<p>Requirements:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>a up to date tool or library (i.e., not a project where development\nhas ceased or stopped three years ago)</li>\n<li>ideally, it should be straightforward to use the tool or library\n(i.e., not a project with zero or almost no documentation)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>--</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update / Clarification:</em></strong>  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I forgot to mention that don\'t need any form of static checking. I<br>\nonly need to check  that the contracts hold during run time. Further\nI only need to use very basic contracts (pre- and postcondition,<br>\ninvariants) applied to only a few methods of my program.</li>\n<li>As Dave as pointed out in the comments, there may be another option\nto apply contracts together with Object Teams. This would mean\nmodifying or extending Object Teams and the CoreJDT module of Object\nTeams (it\'s in the comments).</li>\n<li>I also got <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&amp;frm_id=157" rel="nofollow">a reply from the creator of Object Teams</a> that using JML and Object Teams together via JDT isn\'t an easy fix.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>References:</p>\n\n<p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php?t=thread&amp;frm_id=157" rel="nofollow">1</a> B.

Now I have started to read <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1878739069" rel="nofollow"><em>"Object-Oriented Programming in Turbo C++ first edition (1st edition)"</em></a> by Robert Lafore. I do not have any knowledge of programming which is beyond these books. This book might be outdated because it\'s 20 years old. I do have the latest edition, I am using the old because I like it, mainly I am just studying the basic concepts of OOP used in C++ through the first edition of Lafore\'s book.  </p>\n\n<p>Lafore\'s book emphasizes that "OOP" is only useful for <em>larger</em> and <em>complex</em> programs. It is said in every OOP book (also in Lafore\'s book) that procedural paradigm is prone to errors e.g. the global data as easily vulnerable by the functions. It is said that programmer can make <em>honest</em> errors in procedural languages e.g. by making a function that accidentally corrupts the data.    </p>\n\n<p>Honestly speaking I am posting my question because I am not grasping the explaination given in this book: <a href="http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0672323087" rel="nofollow">Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (4th Edition)</a> I am not grasping these statements written in Lafore\'s book:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Object-oriented programming was developed because limitations were discovered in\n  earlier approaches to programming....\n  As programs grow ever larger and more complex, even the structured programming approach begins to show signs of strain... \n  ....Analyzing the reasons for these failures reveals that there are weaknesses in the procedural paradigm itself. No matter how well the structured programming approach is implemented, large programs become excessively complex....\n  ...There are two related problems. First, functions have unrestricted access to global data. Second, unrelated functions\n  and data, the basis of the procedural paradigm, provide a poor model of the real world...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have studied the book "dysmystified C++" by Jeff Kent, I like this book very much, in this book mostly procedural programming is explained. I do not understand why procedural(structured) programming is weak!</p>\n\n<p>Lafore\'s book explains the concept very nicely with some good examples. Also I have grasped an intuition by reading Lafore\'s book that OOP is better than procedural programming but I am curious to know how exactly in practice procedural programming is weaker than OOP.</p>\n\n<p>I want to see myself what are the practical problems that one would face in procedural programming, how the OOP will make the programming easier. I think I will got my answer just by reading Lafore\'s book contemplatively but I want to see with my own eyes the problems in the procedural code, I want to see how the OOP style code of a program removes the foregoing errors that would happen if the same program were to be written using procedural paradigm.</p>\n\n<p>There are many features of OOP and I understand it is not possible for someone to explain me how all these features removes the foregoing errors that would generate by writing the code in procedural style.</p>\n\n<p>So, here is my question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Which limitations of procedural programming does OOP address and how does it effectively remove these limitations in practice?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In particular, are there examples for programs which are hard to design using the procedural paradigm but are easily designed using OOP?</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '219', 'Title': 'What problems of procedural programming does OOP solve in practice?', 'LastEditorUserId': '98', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-03-28T04:02:51.607', 'LastEditDate': '2014-03-25T08:30:22.733', 'AnswerCount': '6', 'CommentCount': '5', 'Score': '5', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '11633', 'Tags': '<object-oriented><programming-paradigms><procedural-programming>', 'CreationDate': '2014-03-20T14:47:25.803', 'FavoriteCount': '2', 'Id': '22867''color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2}{'Body': '<p>I have been using C for a while, for some reasons I learnt C++. </p>\n\n<p>I can\'t see why object oriented is a "new" feature.
