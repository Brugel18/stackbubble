What about the Fletcher algorithm, does it suffer the same weakness?</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '41', 'Title': 'Is there an adjustment for Adler32 algorithm so it works well on short messages?', 'LastActivityDate': '2013-10-29T17:18:22.143', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '1', 'Score': '0', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '7284', 'Tags': '<adler32><fletcher><checksum>', 'CreationDate': '2013-10-29T14:52:24.617', 'Id': '16547'}
