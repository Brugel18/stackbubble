Before explaining the other functions I will explain what static pattern database is; briefly(Because of the comments below)<br></p>\n\n<h2>What is a (5-5-5) static pattern database for 15-Puzzle?</h2>\n\n<p>Pattern databases are heuristics used to solve a fifteen puzzle(can be any puzzle. But here I will talk about only 15-Puzzle). A heuristic is a number used to determine which state to be expanded next. I is like cost of each state. Here state is a <em>permutation</em> of the 15-Puzzle. For simple puzzles like 8-Puzzle, the heuristic can be <strong>manhattan distance</strong>. It gives the minimum number of moves, for each misplaced tile, to reach <strong>it\'s</strong> goal position. Then manhattan distances for all the tiles are added up to give the cost for that tile. Manhattan distance gives the lower bound to the estimate of the number of moves required to reach the goal state i.e you cannot reach the goal state with moves, less than the manhattan distance. <strong>BUT</strong> manhattan distance is not a very good heuristic, though admissible,  because it does not consider other tiles near by it. If a tile has to be moved to it\'s goal position, the near by tiles also have to be moved and the number of moves increase. So, clearly for these puzzles, the actual cost is mostly much greater that\nthe manhattan distance.<br>\nTo <strong>overcome</strong> this(manhattan distance) and take into account the other tiles, pattern databases were introduced.\nA static patter database holds the heuristics for sub-problems or for a group of tiles to reach for their goal state. Since, you are calculating the number of moves to make these group of tiles reach their goal state, the other tiles in that group will be taken into account when a tiles is being moved. So, this is a better heuristic and mostly will always is greater than manhattan distance.<br>\n5-5-5 static pattern is just a form of static pattern database where the number of groups are 3, two of them containing 5 tiles each and the third one contains 6(6th isthe blank tile).</p>\n\n<h2>One of the groups is this matrix :<br></h2>\n\n<p>1 &nbsp;2 &nbsp;3 &nbsp;4<br>\n0 &nbsp;6 &nbsp;0 &nbsp;0<br>\n0 &nbsp;0 &nbsp;0 &nbsp;0<br>\n0 &nbsp;0 &nbsp;0 &nbsp;0<br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I calculating the heuristics/number_of_moves for all permutations of this group to reach the above configuration and <strong>inserting them into my database</strong>. <br> The total number of combinations(also the no of rows in db) possible is \n<br></p>\n\n<pre><code>16!/(16-5)! = 524160\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><br>  Now, the other functions  - <code>updateIfNecessary(FifteenPuzzle)</code> - this function checks if the array of the passed FifteenPuzzle object is already present in the database. If already present in the database, it checks if the current object\'s cost is less than the cost in DB. If yes, it replaces it with the current cost else does nothing. The function -<code>insert(FifteenPuzzle)</code> inserts a new permutaion with the cost.<br><br>\n<strong>NOTE :</strong> <code>fifteenuzzle.g_n</code> is the cost for the puzzle. For the initial puzzle that represents the matrix above, the cost is <code>0</code> and for each move the cost is <code>incremented by1</code>.<br><br></p>\n\n<p>I have set the stack size to -<code>Xss128m</code>(1024, 512 and 256 were giving a fatal error) for stack size in run configurations. <br>\nCurrently the recursion number or the depth is <strong><code>7,500,000</code> and counting</strong>(value of <code>System.out.println(k++);</code>).\n<br> The total number of combinations possible is \n<br></p>\n\n<pre><code>16!/(16-5)! = 524160\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><br>\nBut the depth has already reached 7,500,000. This is because of generation of duplicate states. Currently the number of entries in the database is <strong>513423</strong>. You might think that there only 10,000 entries to fill up now. But now the rate at which entries are made has decreased drastically about <strong>1 entry every 30 min</strong>. This will never get over then. <br><br>\nI need a solution that is practical - <strong>with or without recursion</strong>.

I started to study previous successful approach first to see if they can be tweaked, and now I am trying to understand the approach using supervised learning with Long Short Term Memory.\nI am reading <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.35.4170" rel="nofollow">"Learning to Forget: Continual Prediction with LSTM"</a>. I am also reading the paper on peephole too, but it seems even more complicated and I\'m just trying something simpler first. I think I get correctly how the memory cell and the network topology work. What I do not get right now is the training algorithm. So I have some questions to ask:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How exactly does different input get distinguished? Apparently the network is not reset after each input, and there is no special symbol to delimit different input. Does the network just receive a continuous stream of strings without any clues on where the input end and the next one begin?</p></li>\n<li><p>What is the time lag between the input and the corresponding target output? Certainly some amount of time lag are required, and thus the network can never be trained to get a target output from an input that it have not have enough time to process. If it was not Reber grammar that was used, but something more complicated that could potentially required a lot more information to be stored and retrieved, the amount of time need to access the information might varied depending on the input, something that probably cannot be predicted while we decide on the time lag to do training.</p></li>\n<li><p>Is there a more intuitive explanation of the training algorithm? I find it difficult to figure out what is going on behind all the complicated formulas, and I would need to understand it because I need to tweak it into a reinforced learning algorithm later.</p></li>\n<li><p>Also, the paper did not mention anything regarding noisy <strong>training</strong> data.

My initial thought is that this is obvious. A rational agent wants to maximize its performance, and the first $T$ time steps are a factor in the performance measure. So for instance, if the environment is in state $A$ at time step 1, the performance measure can be different than being in state $A$ at step 2 since the state of the environment in step 1 is relevant to the performance measure in the latter case. Thus as the performance measures can be different, the rational agent may make different actions.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps that is the answer, but I am still confused on why it matters that the performance measure is concerned with only a finite sequence of initial time steps.

There is a deck of cards that is shuffled randomly; each turn involves drawing the next card from the deck, then making a move.</p>\n\n<p>What algorithms are appropriate for selecting a move, in a game with randomness?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that one approach is to think of this as a three-player game: in addition to the two players, there is a third player (the dealer) who makes a random move.  For instance, if the two players are Minnie and Maxwell, we might alternate moves in the following order: Dealer (chooses a random card for Minnie), Minnie (selects a move), Dealer (chooses a random card for Maxwell), Maxwell (selects a move), and so on.  I think I've read that alpha-beta search can be adapted to this setting.  However, this doesn't sound too promising to me.  There are perhaps 52 possible outcomes of the moves by Dealer, so the tree will be very bushy (with a large branching factor), causing exponential blowup.  Also, this sort of modified alpha-beta search feels a bit inefficient to me.  Each move likely affects a player's score by only a little bit at a time, so we'd expect that the effects of the randomness to average out over many moves, and there is no need to explore all combinations of possible random outcomes.  To put it another way: the game is more about positional elements and random luck than about tactical/combinatorial elements.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a better algorithm framework for randomized games, that takes into account the stochastic element?

This will be the shortest program if the training set is completely random. The good news is that this is an upper bound. For any training set that is not random, there will be a smaller program that will work. Also, the number of programs smaller than upper bound is finite. </p>\n\n<p>A unfortunate result of Kolmogorov complexity is that it cannot be calculated. This is due to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem" rel="nofollow">halting problem</a>. We can\'t know if any program will stop until it does.</p>\n\n<p>If the question is "Write pi," then the program that produces the correct answer would never halt because pi has infinite digits. An answer infinitely long is never desirable so I think the best way to deal with this is to put an <strong>arbitrary limit on the length of the answer</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>With that additional constraint, here is an (inefficient) program that will generate a correct solution program shorter than the upper bound if one exists. (sorry of this is confusing, but these steps outline a program that generates programs that implement an algorithm to map questions to answers in a training set):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create the "upper bound" program. One that maps each input in the training set directly to its output.</li>\n<li>Generate every possible program that is shorter than the upper bound and list them from shortest to longest.</li>\n<li>Starting with the shortest program, run the first step of every program. </li>\n<li>Stop when a correct program is found.</li>\n<li>Eliminate programs that stop without a correct answer or produce an answer longer than the arbitrary limit.</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 3-5 running the second step, third step, etc. of the programs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This program has the following benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It limits the number of programs to those smaller than the "upper bound" program.</li>\n<li>It avoids the halting problem by\n<ul>\n<li>incorporating an arbitrary limit to the length of the answer and </li>\n<li>executing step x in all programs before moving on to step x+1 so that the solution will be found before looping infinity.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The main disadvantage is that it is terribly slow. It takes millions of years to crack a 128 bit password and I think this program could have comparable performance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, the questions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do you see any significant flaws in this solution?</p></li>\n<li><p>Can this program\'s performance be improved in any significant way\nwithout introducing onerous constraints?</p></li>\n</ul>\n', 'ViewCount': '95', 'Title': 'What program will derive the underlying algorithm in these question-answer pairs (updated)?', 'LastEditorUserId': '12742', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-01-14T22:27:00.303', 'LastEditDate': '2014-01-14T22:27:00.303', 'AnswerCount': '1', 'CommentCount': '1', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '19682', 'Score': '-1', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '12742', 'Tags': '<machine-learning><artificial-intelligence>', 'CreationDate': '2014-01-12T04:09:23.450', 'Id': '19663'}{'color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2,'Body': '<p>I need to link facts to actions through rules.

Instead of using an approach like if-else-if-else, I am using a set of "scorers" with specified weights to determine what the best move is.</p>\n\n<p>You might think that for a game like Minesweeper Flags, it\'s only about making moves that gives you the highest probability of taking a mine, but it\'s not that simple. Which move the computer will make usually depends on several features for that specific move in the current game state. Examples of features: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What\'s the probability of this move scoring a mine?</li>\n<li>What\'s the probability of revealing anything to my opponent here?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Description of the system</h3>\n\n<p>The system basically works like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>"Pre-scorers": Some pre-analysis is done for the current game state (in terms of Minesweeper Flags, this is usually: Calculating all the probabilities)</li>\n<li>"Scorers": A set of ordinary scorers are asked to determine the score for each possible move, each scorer applies scores according to it\'s own criteria. The scorers can check the results of the pre-analysis that was made.</li>\n<li>The scores calculated in the above step is summed together and is set to be the score for a move.</li>\n<li>The moves are sorted according to their score and ranked so that all moves with the same score gets the same rank.</li>\n<li>"Post-scorers": The result of the above can be sent to "Post-scorers" that have the possibility to modify the scores of any fields in any way they want, according to the post-scorer\'s own rules.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>When combining a bunch of pre-scorers, scorers (with their weights) and post-scorers, it\'s becomes what I call a <strong>score configuration</strong>.</p>\n\n<h3>Example result</h3>\n\n<p>This is an example of scores having been applied to Minesweeper Flags. This is the map that was scored:</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/aIRiz.png" alt="Minesweeper Flags map that was scored"></p>\n\n<p>And this is the output of an actual score configuration. It is showing the rank of the possible moves, where 1 is the best rank and has been highlighted in white:</p>\n\n<p><img src="http://i.stack.imgur.com/ArJG4.png" alt="Example output of scoring approach"></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to having written highly flexible code, this approach to AIs can be inserted into other games as well.</p>\n\n<h3>Advantages and disadvantages</h3>\n\n<p>Below are some advantages and disadvantages of this system that I can think of myself</p>\n\n<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It\'s very easy to create a whole lot of different configurations for AIs.</li>\n<li>It is possible to use with Genetic Algorithms: Each scorer has an associated weight, the weight can become the gene.</li>\n<li>Using some tools, it is possible to check why a specific move was made and which scorers were mainly responsible for that move</li>\n<li>Using tools, it is possible to create a map of the overall score/rank of possible moves (like the screenshot above)</li>\n<li>By applying scores to the way the human plays, it is possible to create an "#AI_Mirror" which tries to make moves that it thinks the human would make</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It can be extremely difficult to adjust a score configuration "correctly", to make the AI play as good as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is the system I have built here widely known in the AI world? What would it be called in real AI terms?</p></li>\n<li><p>Does this approach make sense or is there a different approach that you would recommend?</p></li>\n<li><p>What ways are there that could make the process of tweaking a score configuration easier?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regarding the last question, I am aware of the possibility of using genetic algorithms, I am also mildly aware of <a href="http://artint.info/html/ArtInt_272.html" rel="nofollow">SARSA</a> (and I do think my scorers resembles that site\'s description of features with weights, but from my understanding that\'s not exactly what I have created here). I think that a problem with SARSA is that you don\'t know the reward until the game is over, the best move is often a move which doesn\'t give a reward (a mine) at all. Your current chances of winning depends on both the current score (how many mines you and your opponent have taken) and what the current map looks like.</p>\n', 'Tags': '<algorithms><artificial-intelligence><computer-games>', 'LastEditorUserId': '14926', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-03-22T15:34:07.950', 'CommentCount': '0', 'AcceptedAnswerId': '21982', 'CreationDate': '2014-02-12T19:44:49.750', 'Id': '21981'}{'color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2,'ViewCount': '46', 'Title': 'What are the state-of-the-art algorithms for pathfinding on a continuous map of the Earth?', 'LastEditDate': '2014-02-24T19:22:56.753', 'AnswerCount': '2', 'Score': '12', 'OwnerDisplayName': 'Deer Hunter', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '14799', 'Body': "<p>Suppose I have got a solar-powered autonomous surface vessel somewhere in the fjords of Norway, supplied with a fairly recent set of maps, a GPS receiver, and no means of downlinking detailed commands from me.
