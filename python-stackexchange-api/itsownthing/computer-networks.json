Common network topologies include the mesh, torus, ring, star, tree, etc. These topologies can be studied analytically to determine properties related to their expected performance; such characteristics include diameter (maximal distance between a pair of nodes, in terms of the number of links which must be crossed if such nodes communicate), the average distance between nodes (over all pairs of nodes in the network), and the bisection bandwidth (the worst-case bandwidth between two halves of the network). Naturally, other topologies and metrics exist.</p>\n\n<p>Consider a network topology based on the Koch snowflake. The simplest incarnation of such a topology consists of three nodes and three links in a fully-connected setup. The diameter is 1, average distance is 1 (or 2/3, if you include communications inside a node), etc.</p>\n\n<p>The next incarnation of the topology consists of 12 nodes and 15 links. There are three clusters of three nodes fully, each cluster being fully connected by three links. Additionally, there are the three original nodes, connecting the three clusters using six additional links.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the number of nodes and links in incarnation $k$ are described by the following recurrence relations:\n$$N(1) = 3$$\n$$L(1) = 3$$\n$$N(k+1) = N(k) + 3L(k)$$\n$$L(k+1) = 5L(k)$$\nHopefully, the shape of this topology is clear; incarnation $k$ looks like the $k^{th}$ incarnation of the Koch snowflake.

If anything, this seems to be more of a "ring of rings", or something along those lines. Naturally, tweaks could be made to the definition of this topology, and more advanced questions could be asked (for instance, we could assign different bandwidths to links introduced at earlier stages, or discuss scheduling or data placement for such a topology).

In a peer-to-peer network I needed to send an action to all peers, and each peer was to act on it only if it could verify that all other peers would also act on it.</p>\n\n<p>That is, given a network of peers $P = { P_1, ..., P_n }$. We wish to send, from some source peer $P_s$ a message to all other peers. This message contains an action which must be performed. The peer should perform this action if and only if every other peer will perform the action. That is, it performs the action if it can verify that all other peers will also have receipt of the action and can perform the same verification.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is subject to these conditions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is no implicit message delivery guarantee: if $P_x$ sends a message to $P_y$ there is no way for $P_x$ to know if $P_y$ gets the message. (Of course $P_y$ can send a receipt, but that receipt is subject to the same constraint)</li>\n<li>Additional messages with any payload may be created.</li>\n<li>There is no total ordering on the messages received by peers. Messages can arrive in a different time-order than which they were sent.

A message cannot inherently be detected as lost. <em>Most messages will be delivered quickly, or truly lost.</em></li>\n<li>Each peer has a synchronized clock.

Since Waxman\'s algorithm generates edges probabilistically, I usually end up with disconnected nodes. How do I connect the rest of the nodes to the topology in a way consistent with Waxman\'s algorithm, i.e. simulates a real network topology?</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of ways to "finish" the topology by connecting the disconnected nodes, but I don\'t know which one is the most compatible with the already-generated edges.

The condition for delivering a message m to the application, is that another message has been received from each other process with a large timestamp. This guarantees that there are no more messages underway with a lower timestamp."</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a definition from a book. I tried to apply this definition to an example but I guess that something is wrong.</p>\n\n<h3>Example.</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are 4 processes and they multicast the following messages (second number in parentheses is timestamp) :<br>\n  P1 multi-casts (m11, 5);  (m12, 12); (m13, 14);<br>\n  P2 multi-casts (m21, 6); (m22, 14);<br>\n  P3 multi-casts (m31, 5); (m32, 7); (m33, 11);<br>\n  P4 multi-casts (m41, 8); (m42, 15); (m43, 19).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Supposing that there are no acknoledgments, can I guess which messages can be delivered and which not? Based on definition, my guess is that only m11 and m31 can be delivered to the application, because all the other messages received will have a timestamp greater, but this seems very strange, and I think I didn\'t understand the delivery condition very well. I have an exam next week and in general I\'d like to understand this mechanism.</p>\n', 'ViewCount': '73', 'Title': 'totally ordered multicast with Lamport timestamp', 'LastEditorUserId': '16819', 'LastActivityDate': '2014-04-20T13:25:52.457', 'LastEditDate': '2014-04-20T13:25:52.457', 'AnswerCount': '0', 'CommentCount': '2', 'Score': '3', 'PostTypeId': '1', 'OwnerUserId': '16819', 'Tags': '<distributed-systems><computer-networks><synchronization><communication-protocols><message-passing>', 'CreationDate': '2014-04-16T07:26:03.173', 'FavoriteCount': '1', 'Id': '23847'}{'color':getRandomColor(),'shape':'dot','label':'Strings', 'size': 60, 'isExploded':false, "precedence": 2,'Body': '<p>Why does packet don\'t need trailer/footer while frame needs it?</p>\n\n<p>I am trying to understand networking concept regarding OSI &amp; TCP/IP layering.
